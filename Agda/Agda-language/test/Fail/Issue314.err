Issue314.agda:13,9-13
I'm not sure if there should be a case for the constructor refl,
because I get stuck when trying to solve the following unification
problems (inferred index ≟ expected index):
  x ≟ _y_7 x
Possible reason why unification failed:
  Cannot solve variable x of type A with solution _y_7 x because the
  variable occurs in the solution, or in the type of one of the
  variables in the solution.
when checking that the pattern refl has type x ≡ _y_7 x
